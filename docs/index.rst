BIDS Apps Runner
===============

A small toolbox to:

- build Apptainer images (``.sif``) from Docker images
- run BIDS Apps from JSON configuration files (local workstation)
- optionally validate outputs and reprocess missing subjects
- wire the JSON runner into the new browser-based GUI (see :doc:`gui`)
